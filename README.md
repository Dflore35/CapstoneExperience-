# CapstoneExperience-
This project is an informative experience that lets the user understand why the Psyche mission is important and what we are hoping to discover by visiting Psyche. 

I learned how to program in A-Frame using glitch.com. I also received help from my team members especially Micah Schmidt and couldn't have done it without them. I pushed the finished prototype here on GitHub pages. I got the text directly from the ASU NASA website and the pictures are just placed holders while Thom Kim finishes the ones he did. 
The earth picture is from a  "presentation at JPL by the lead of the Psyche mission, Dr. Lindy Elkins-Tanton, to get familiar with the Psyche: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0bFP5HZaII" and Psyche is from the ASU website video https://psyche.asu.edu/mission/the-asteroid/

You can run the code here on GitHub pages.
